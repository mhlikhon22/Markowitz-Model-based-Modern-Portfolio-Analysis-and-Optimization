# Markowitz-Model-based-Modern-Portfolio-Analysis-and-Optimization
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing, optimizing, &amp; observing an investment portfolio consisting of around ten DS30 stocks. The core objective is to assess historical performance and determine the optimal allocation to maximize returns while managing required risk-return. This analysis is based on data from 15 January 2023 to 12 January 2025.

The project is divided into the following components:
### 1.	Data Collection
Historical closing prices of multiple stocks (e.g., BSCCL, KBPPWBIL, SQURPHARMA, etc.) were collected.
### 2.	Statistical Analysis
Key metrics such as annual returns, risk measures, and weights are calculated for each instrument.
### 3.	Portfolio Optimization
Using the computed statistics, the optimal portfolio is constructed by determining the ideal weight allocation for each instrument. The optimization aims to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk. Details like the number of shares, amount invested, and price per share are included.
### 4.	Observations and Insights
The final sheet presents observations including unrealized gains, realized gains, market prices, total costs, and weight of each asset in the portfolio.

## Portfolio Performance Summary
Over a 10-day holding period, an initial investment of 99,986.30 BDT generated 1,333.10 BDT profit, yielding a 1.33% HPR and an annualized return of 36.81%.
Top performers included KOHINOOR (14.02% HPR), WALTONHIL (4.95%), and PRIMEBANK (2.53%), while GP, MJLBD, and PADMAOIL posted small losses. Gains from high-performing assets outweighed the losses, resulting in a net positive outcome.
The portfolioâ€™s diversified structure effectively mitigated downside risk, and results indicate strong short-term performance with high annualized growth potential.
